**Powered by Algorand's Sandbox and PyTeal library**

### Problem Statement üé´
  
- [x] Build a smart contract for a simple auction.
- [x] The smart contract is initiated with a minimum bid amount and a time limit.
- [x] The contract keeps track of the owner‚Äôs wallet.
- [x] Any user can call the ‚Äúbid‚Äù function with a bid amount.
- [x] If the bid amount is less than the minimum bid amount, the transaction fails.
- [x] If the bid amount is less than the previous highest bidder, the transaction fails.
- [x] Otherwise, the current bidder becomes the highest bidder and the bid amount for the previous highest bidder is returned to that bidder.
- [x] After the bid time limit has expired, no further bidding is permitted.
- [x] The owner (only) should be able to call the ‚Äúclose_bid‚Äù function to close the bidding and transfer the bid amount to the owner.
